When the user asks to create a new project:

1. Ask for the project name.
2. Create a directory with that name in ~/projects/.
3. Inside it, create:
   - index.html with a basic page structure and the project name
     as the title
   - styles.css with sensible defaults (font, spacing, colors)
   - README.md with the project name and a one-line description
   - CLAUDE.md with basic project preferences
4. Confirm what was created.
