# Snake Game Project

This is a self-contained Snake game built in a single HTML file.

## Project context

- Single file: `index.html` contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- No build step required — open in browser directly
- Built in Chapter 3 of *Claude Code for Beginners*

## How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser:
- macOS: `open index.html`
- Windows: `start index.html`

## When working with Claude Code

- To change colors: describe the color you want (e.g., "make the snake yellow")
- To add features: describe the feature (e.g., "add a high score tracker")
- All changes go in `index.html` — no other files needed
